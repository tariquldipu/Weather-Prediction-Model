## Weather Prediction Model Using Machine Learning

In this python notebook I've tried to build a weather prediction model based on the dataset that contains a century of historical averages of global temperatures, including global maximum temperatures, global minimum temperatures, and global land and ocean temperatures. I've used supervised regression machine learning method for building up this model. The dataset was collected from Kaggle.

All the steps are explained inside the notebook file.

**Used Libraries-** Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn, Numpy
